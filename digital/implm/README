To perform digital implementation create a `work` directory, and from it run
`source ../run_init`.

mkdir -p work && cd work && source ../run_init ; cd ..

Once Innovus has completed loading the new project, run source the
floorplaning, powerplanning, and implementation TCL scripts.

When it is done all relevant files have been generated, and you can open gui by
typing `gui_show`, or exit with `exit`.

If you want to load a previously generated design database, first open innovus with
`source ../run_innvs` and then run `read_db <dbname>`.
