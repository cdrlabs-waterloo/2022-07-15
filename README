Design described in:

    Stangherlin, Kleber, and Manoj Sachdev. "Design and Implementation of a Secure
    RISC-V Microprocessor.", 2022.

The environment variable `ROOT_DIR` must be defined to the root directory.

Tech specific files were removed. Cadence tools are used for library
characterization, synthesis, and digital implementation. To simulate, you must
add RAM and RF memory models. Also, models must added for the two oscillators
instantiated in `clkg.v` and `rng.v`.

The design directly instantiate several library cells. Replace them by the
cells available in your technology.

The `cmbtr.v` file is generated by the `digital/python/cmbtr.py` script.

Acronyms are as follows:

    PLN: no counter-measures
    CMO: Boolean masking
    DLO: Boolean masking + Pre-charge logic
